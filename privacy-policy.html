                    their mobile or device’s network. It leverages blockchain technology and allows users to get paid per
                    kilobyte of their data consumed by a beneficiary. Wicrypt has an inbuilt wallet that verifies that the
                    beneficiary has enough cryptocurrency in order to make use of its services. A user is at liberty to set
                    their price range per kilobyte of data consumed. The App automatically cuts off a beneficiary when his
                    money is exhausted and as well allows automatic connection between a user and a beneficiary once the
                    beneficiary has enough funds to utilize the App’s services.</p>
